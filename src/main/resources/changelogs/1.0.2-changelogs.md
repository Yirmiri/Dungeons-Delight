## Version Release v1.0.2 Forge-1.20.1

### Note
- I am currently aware of a common issue causing Stained Scrap not to drop, I am currently investigating this but have
failed to recreate this issue in any instance.
- I am also aware of an issue with Sinytra Connector and RunicLib, I am not quite fond of fixing issues with Sinytra
due to its naturally instability, but I will try taking a look sometime soon. A temporary fix could be to use the Fabric
version of RunicLib.

### Additions
- Rancid Reduction has been reworked so instead of interacting to convert a crop it now can be thrown to rot all crops in a 3x3 area for a short time.
Due to the Rancid Reduction rework you can no longer consume or feed it to Wormroots, however when Rancid Reduction hits a block it will
create a field of rancid clouds that will grant entities that step in it Exudation III and Weakness I for 0:15
- Rancid Reduction can now be shot out of a dispenser
- Monster Muffins can now be composted (85% chance to increase level)
- Added a client configuration for disabling/enabling monster effect backgrounds (useful for cases of incompatibilities,
will be looking for a better fix for specifically the incompatibilities with JEED in the future)
- Translations have been added for zh_cn, Chinese (Simplified) (Credits: @0Starocean0, @AnkakeUdon, @IwasConfused, and @RaymondBlaze)

### Changes
- Monster Pots now have their own custom steam particle
- Dungeon Stoves no longer require a Netherite Scrap and 2 Stained Scrap blocks but instead just 3 Stained Scraps
- Wormroots now generate much less often
- Wild Rotbulbs can now be cut for 2 Gunk and a 50% chance for 2 Purple Dye
- Wild Rotbulbs now only drop one Rotbulbling
- Tweaked the texture of Netherite Cleavers
- Added a custom model for Stained Scrap Bars
- A sound now plays when you harvest a Rotbulb...

### Fixes
- Fixed Rotbulbs not naturally generating (additionally there is now a tag to control the biomes they spawn in)
- Fixed an issue causing Gunk to not be cut at a Cutting Board, they now can for a chance of various useful materials
- Monster Pots now stack to 1 to match Farmer's Delight's Cooking Pot
- Fixed the Wormroot Door item texture being 1 pixel too high
- Removed Opal Otter...?
