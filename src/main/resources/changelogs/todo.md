### Important (MUST DO BEFORE v1.0)
- Configs
- Monster yam summons entities instead of attacking
- Monster yam seeds spawn underground
- Final items (oden n such)
- Advancements (covert crop, chop gunk, eat horse)

### Post Release v1.0 Ideas
- Wormroots rework (new BF-like log system)
- Monster Yam convert crops
- Signs for wormwood (no boats, wood is too brittle)
- Slime foods have a chance to not be consumed
- Cleavers disable all cleavers when on cooldown
- Datagen monster cooking recipes
- Double Stacked Monster Burger, a placeable food block that is late game
- Rotgut status effect
- Ancient food shockwave aoe attack
- Ancient Eggs dissolve killed entities into experience
- Advancement for cutting a thrown Ancient Egg midair with a thrown Cleaver
- Serrated II Cleavers can cut Grass and drop Straw
- Cleavers can be shot out of Dispensers
- Dragon and telepotage (save for End update?)
- Dragon Initiate effect
- Special death message for Voracity (it is preferred to not use a new damage type)
- Gunk arrows, mob run to mobs with gunk stuck into them (Rotten Odor effect)
- Cleavers can cut pies and cakes when thrown
- Maybe UI overlay for Voracity so it feels cooler?
- Easier method for obtaining stained scrap, perhaps more common ways of finding spawners?

### 1.21.1(+?)
- Move to MultiLoader project
- Biteable foods rework
- Hunger icons on status effects that change hunger
- Right click Spiders for Spider Extract
