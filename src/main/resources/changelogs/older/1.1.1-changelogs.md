## v1.1.1 Forge-1.20.1

### Additions
- Added "A Slice of Life" advancement for obtaining a stained weapon, description provides players a small hint
on how the weapons works
- Translations have been updated for ja_jp, Japanese (Credits: @AnkakeUdon)
- Translations have been updated for zh_cn, Chinese (Simplified) (Credits: @AnkakeUdon, @IwasConfused)
- Translations have been updated for zh_tw, Chinese (Traditional) (Credits: @DEEMsss)

### Changes
- Renamed & updated the id of all instances of the word "Ossobusco" -> "Ossobuco", because apparently I have been 
misspelling it for the last THREE MONTHS
- Ossobuco now only grants 02:00 of Voracity II to line up with the amount of refill time Ossobuco grants
- Dungeon Stoves now remove experience like other Living Fire sources when burnt by it

### Tweaks
- Slightly raised the volume of `cleaver_hit_entity` sound

### Fixes
- Fixed Living Campfires not properly displaying cooked items or emitting particles
- The cleaver throw sound no longer has a small delay at the start so it syncs up with the action of throwing a 
cleaver (alongside this a few other sound files were also shortened)

## Mod Integration
### Integration Additions
- [Amendments] Living Torches now set entities on fire when attacked like other torches

### Integration Fixes
