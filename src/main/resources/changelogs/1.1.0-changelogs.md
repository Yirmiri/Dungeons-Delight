## Forgotten Feasts || v1.1.0 Forge-1.20.1

### Additions
- Added Spider Bubble Tea, when consumed it will amplify a random level I effect but halve its duration, if the user
  has no level I effects then Pouncing II will be granted for 02:00
- Added Persistence, a new enchantment for the cleaver with 3 levels that slows monsters that drop knife/cleaver drops 
for 3s and 1s per level, allows the user to pick up cleavers that hit the ground to reset their cleaver cooldowns, and increases how long cleavers 
stay in the ground by 2s per level. Persistence is mutually exclusive with Serrated Strike and decreases attack damage by -1.
- Added Rotten Spawner, cannot be obtained in survival and when broken it drops 4-8 Gunk and 8-12 Stained Scrap
- Gunk is now placeable as a multiface block
- Translations have been added for ja_jp, Japanese (Credits: @SAGA23456)
