## Forgotten Feasts || v1.1.0 Forge-1.20.1

### Notes
- I just wanted to put a lil thank you to Hecco for helping out with finishing up this update with me, it means a lot !!!

### Additions
- Added Rotten Dungeons, a rarer versions of Dungeons that are filled with Gunk and Rotbulbs, this is the new way of
obtaining Rotbulbs as the previous generation has been removed. The Cobblestone inside the Dungeon is also now partially
replaced with Infested Cobblestone to allow easy access to Silverfish Abdomens.
- Added Rotten Spawner, cannot be obtained in survival and when broken it drops 4-8 Gunk and 8-12 Stained Scrap
- Living Fire versions of all light blocks have been added (Torches, Campfires, and Lanterns)
- Added Living Candles, emit a faint glow but mostly decorative (@Hecco56), can be used on Monster Cakes
- Added Stained Scrap Chains
- Added Spider Bubble Tea, when consumed it will amplify a random level I effect but halve its duration, if the user
has no level I effects then Pouncing II will be granted for 02:00
- Added Spider Donut, new placeable food that can be stacked up to 5 on one block or hung from the roof
- Added Persistence, a new enchantment for the cleaver with 3 levels that slows monsters that drop knife/cleaver drops 
for 3s and 1s per level, allows the user to pick up cleavers that hit the ground to reset their cleaver cooldowns, and increases how long cleavers 
stay in the ground by 2s per level. Persistence is mutually exclusive with Serrated Strike and decreases attack damage by -1.
- Added Retraction, a new enchantment for the cleaver with 1 level that pulls struck entities towards it, increases
throw range by 0.75 but decreases attack damage by 1.5. Retraction is mutually exclusive with Ricochet.
- Gunk is now placeable as a multiface block
- Translations have been added for ja_jp, Japanese (Credits: @SAGA23456)
